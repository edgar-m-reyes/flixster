### Notes
Image sizes were the biggest issue I dealt with in this lab. There was a default setting that caused my collection view to estimate size which would force decrease the size of the poster images.

### Notes
Some of the challenges I had were finding certain features in XCode due to their UI change with their newest update. I also had some issues with cocoapods as all the dependencies listed in the codepath cocoapods weren't required in the final rendition of the project.
